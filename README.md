# Junit

Junit test is tested by using function testCreate, testRead all, test Single row, test update the information and test delete function and all these function were success.
There are couple of API and framework we had imported like org.junit.jupiter APIand org.springframework.
There are some annotation as well like SpringBoot Test, Test Method Order, Autowired, test(to run Junit test) and Order (creating order series)
